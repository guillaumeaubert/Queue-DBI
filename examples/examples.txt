To see examples for this distribution, it is recommended you read the test
scripts included under ./t, which cover the basic usage of the modules.

If you have any example scripts that use the distribution in interesting ways
or make good use of the features available, please feel free to submit one
(preferably with a pull request on GitHub).

Important: note that any script you submit will be bundled into the
distribution with the same license as the distribution itself.

Thank you,
Guillaume
