        - Fixed MySQL-specific reference when retrieving the inserted queue
          element ID.

        - Added missing prerequisite.

v1.7.0  2011-12-16
        - Changed version number convention to always use two dots. This allows
          correct conversion to integer for CPAN. Bumped to 1.7 to allow proper
          indexing of the changes made in 1.6.1.

v1.6.1  2011-12-16
        - Corrected meta information, added list of prerequisites, minor
          documentation corrections.

        - Added more documentation and tests.
        - Public release.

v1.5.0  2010-08-19
        - Prevented locking twice a queue element.

v1.4.0  2010-08-05
        - Fixed problem with the internal max_id cache preventing runaway
          dequeueing (dequeue-enqueue-dequeue would fail on the last dequeue to
          see the last enqueued element when using the same $queue object).

v1.3.0  2010-08-03
        - Added option to limit how many times a queue element can be requeued
          before it stops being pulled.

v1.2.0  2010-06-28
        - Modified requeue() - returns error without a die() to indicate a
          problem that is not the responsibility of this module.
        - Improved algorithm to detect possible parallelization conflicts.

v1.1.0  2010-06-18
        - Locking mechanism improvements, courtesy of Jamie McCarthy.
