Revision history for Queue-DBI

1.7.1   12/16/2011
        Added missing prerequisite.

1.7.0   12/16/2011
        Changed version number convention to always use two dots. This allows
        correct conversion to integer for CPAN. Bumped to 1.7 to allow proper
        indexing of the changes made in 1.6.1.

1.6.1   12/16/2011
        Corrected meta information, added list of prerequisites, minor
        documentation corrections.

1.6.0   12/16/2011
        Added more documentation and tests. Public release.

1.5.0   08/19/2010
        Prevented locking twice a queue element.

1.4.0   08/05/2010
        Fixed problem with the internal max_id cache preventing runaway
        dequeueing (dequeue-enqueue-dequeue would fail on the last dequeue to
        see the last enqueued element when using the same $queue object).

1.3.0   08/03/2010
        Added option to limit how many times a queue element can be requeued
        before it stops being pulled.

1.2.0   06/28/2010
        Modified requeue() - returns error without a die() to indicate a problem
        that is not the responsibility of this module.
        Improved algorithm to detect possible parallelization conflicts.
