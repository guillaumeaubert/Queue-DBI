=head1 NAME

Queue::DBI::Element - An object representing an element pulled from the queue.


=head1 VERSION

Version 1.8.0

=cut

our $VERSION = '1.8.0';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

Please refer to the documentation for Queue::DBI.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Create a new Queue::DBI::Element object.

	my $element = Queue::DBI::Element->new(
		'queue'         => $queue,
		'data'          => $data,
		'id'            => $id,
		'requeue_count' => $requeue_count,
	);

All parameters are mandatory and correspond respectively to the Queue::DBI
object used to pull the element's data, the data, the ID of the element
in the database and the number of times the element has been requeued before.

It is not recommended for direct use. You should be using the following to get
Queue::DBI::Element objects:

	my $queue = $queue->next();

=cut

sub new
{
	my ( $class, %args ) = @_;
	
	# Check parameters
	foreach my $arg ( qw( data id requeue_count ) )
	{
		croak "Argument '$arg' is needed to create the Queue::DBI object"
			if !defined( $args{$arg} ) || ( $args{$arg} eq '' );
	}
	croak 'Pass a Queue::DBI object to create an Queue::DBI::Element object'
		unless defined( $args{'queue'} ) && $args{'queue'}->isa( 'Queue::DBI' );
	
	# Create the object
	my $self = bless(
		{
			'queue'         => $args{'queue'},
			'data'          => $args{'data'},
			'id'            => $args{'id'},
			'requeue_count' => $args{'requeue_count'},
		},
		$class
	);
	
	return $self;
}


=head2 lock()

Locks the element so that another process acting on the queue cannot get a hold
of it

	if ( $element->lock() )
	{
		print "Element successfully locked.\n";
	}
	else
	{
		print "The element has already been removed or locked.\n";
	}

=cut

sub lock ## no critic (Subroutines::ProhibitBuiltinHomonyms)
{
	my ( $self ) = @_;
	my $queue = $self->queue();
	my $verbose = $queue->verbose();
	my $dbh = $queue->get_dbh();
	carp "Entering lock()." if $verbose;
	
	my $rows = $dbh->do(
		sprintf(
			q|
				UPDATE %s
				SET lock_time = ?
				WHERE queue_element_id = ?
					AND lock_time IS NULL
			|,
			$dbh->quote_identifier( $queue->get_queue_elements_table_name() ),
		),
		{},
		time(),
		$self->id(),
	) || croak 'Cannot lock element: ' . $dbh->errstr;
	
	my $success = ( defined( $rows ) && ( $rows == 1 ) ) ? 1 : 0;
	carp "Element locked: " . ( $success ? 'success' : 'already locked or gone' ) . "." if $verbose;
	
	carp "Leaving lock()." if $verbose;
	return $success;
}


=head2 requeue()

In case the processing of an element has failed

	if ( $element->requeue() )
	{
		print "Element successfully requeued.\n";
	}
	else
	{
		print "The element has already been removed or been requeued.\n";
	}

=cut

sub requeue
{
	my ( $self ) = @_;
	my $queue = $self->queue();
	my $verbose = $queue->verbose();
	my $dbh = $queue->get_dbh();
	carp "Entering requeue()." if $verbose;
	
	my $rows = $dbh->do(
		sprintf(
			q|
				UPDATE %s
				SET
					lock_time = NULL,
					requeue_count = requeue_count + 1
				WHERE queue_element_id = ?
					AND lock_time IS NOT NULL
			|,
			$dbh->quote_identifier( $queue->get_queue_elements_table_name() ),
		),
		{},
		$self->id(),
	);
	
	# Since Queue::DBI does not enclose the SELECTing of a queue_element
	# to be requeued, and this actual requeueing, it is possible for the
	# element to be requeued by another process in-between. It may even
	# be requeued, relocked, and successfully removed in-between. In either
	# case, the number of rows affected would be 0, and do() would return
	# 0E0, perl's "0 but true" value. This is not an error. However, if
	# -1 or undef is returned, DBI.pm encountered some sort of error.
	if ( ! defined( $rows ) || $rows == -1 )
	{
		# Always carp the information, since it is an error that
		# most likely doesn't come from this module.
		my $error = $dbh->errstr();
		carp 'Cannot requeue element: ' . ( defined( $error ) ? $error : 'no error returned by DBI' );
		return 0;
	}
	
	my $requeued = ( $rows == 1 ) ? 1 : 0;
	carp "Element requeued: " . ( $requeued ? 'done' : 'already requeued or gone' ) . "." if $verbose;
	
	# Update the requeue_count on the object as well if the database update was
	# successful.
	$self->{'requeue_count'}++
		if $requeued;
	
	carp "Leaving requeue()." if $verbose;
	return $requeued;
}


=head2 success()

Removes the element from the queue after its processing has successfully been
completed.

	if ( $element->success() )
	{
		print "Element successfully removed from queue.\n";
	}
	else
	{
		print "The element has already been removed.\n";
	}

	# Possible improvement:
	# Add $self->{'lock_time'} in lock() and insist that it matches that value
	# when trying to delete the element here.
	
	# First, we try to delete the LOCKED element.
	my $rows = $dbh->do(

				FROM %s
				WHERE queue_element_id = ?
