=head1 NAME

Queue::DBI::Element - An object representing an element pulled from the queue.


=head1 VERSION

Version 2.2.1

=cut

our $VERSION = '2.2.1';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

Please refer to the documentation for Queue::DBI.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Create a new Queue::DBI::Element object.

	my $element = Queue::DBI::Element->new(
		'queue'         => $queue,
		'data'          => $data,
		'id'            => $id,
		'requeue_count' => $requeue_count,
		'created'       => $created,
	);

All parameters are mandatory and correspond respectively to the Queue::DBI
object used to pull the element's data, the data, the ID of the element
in the database and the number of times the element has been requeued before.

It is not recommended for direct use. You should be using the following to get
Queue::DBI::Element objects:

	my $queue = $queue->next();

=cut

sub new
{
	my ( $class, %args ) = @_;
	
	# Check parameters
	foreach my $arg ( qw( data id requeue_count created ) )
	{
		croak "Argument '$arg' is needed to create the Queue::DBI object"
			if !defined( $args{$arg} ) || ( $args{$arg} eq '' );
	}
	croak 'Pass a Queue::DBI object to create an Queue::DBI::Element object'
		unless defined( $args{'queue'} ) && $args{'queue'}->isa( 'Queue::DBI' );
	
	# Create the object
	my $self = bless(
		{
			'queue'         => $args{'queue'},
			'data'          => $args{'data'},
			'id'            => $args{'id'},
			'requeue_count' => $args{'requeue_count'},
			'created'       => $args{'created'},
		},
		$class
	);
	
	return $self;
}


=head2 lock()

Locks the element so that another process acting on the queue cannot get a hold
of it

	if ( $element->lock() )
	{
		print "Element successfully locked.\n";
	}
	else
	{
		print "The element has already been removed or locked.\n";
	}

=cut

sub lock ## no critic (Subroutines::ProhibitBuiltinHomonyms)
{
	my ( $self ) = @_;
	my $queue = $self->get_queue();
	my $verbose = $queue->get_verbose();
	my $dbh = $queue->get_dbh();
	carp "Entering lock()." if $verbose;
	
	my $rows = $dbh->do(
		sprintf(
			q|
				UPDATE %s
				SET lock_time = ?
				WHERE queue_element_id = ?
					AND lock_time IS NULL
			|,
			$dbh->quote_identifier( $queue->get_queue_elements_table_name() ),
		),
		{},
		time(),
		$self->id(),
	) || croak 'Cannot lock element: ' . $dbh->errstr;
	
	my $success = ( defined( $rows ) && ( $rows == 1 ) ) ? 1 : 0;
	carp "Element locked: " . ( $success ? 'success' : 'already locked or gone' ) . "." if $verbose;
	
	carp "Leaving lock()." if $verbose;
	return $success;
}


=head2 requeue()

In case the processing of an element has failed

	if ( $element->requeue() )
	{
		print "Element successfully requeued.\n";
	}
	else
	{
		print "The element has already been removed or been requeued.\n";
	}

=cut

sub requeue
{
	my ( $self ) = @_;
	my $queue = $self->get_queue();
	my $verbose = $queue->get_verbose();
	my $dbh = $queue->get_dbh();
	carp "Entering requeue()." if $verbose;
	
	my $rows = $dbh->do(
		sprintf(
			q|
				UPDATE %s
				SET
					lock_time = NULL,
					requeue_count = requeue_count + 1
				WHERE queue_element_id = ?
					AND lock_time IS NOT NULL
			|,
			$dbh->quote_identifier( $queue->get_queue_elements_table_name() ),
		),
		{},
		$self->id(),
	);
	
	# Since Queue::DBI does not enclose the SELECTing of a queue_element
	# to be requeued, and this actual requeueing, it is possible for the
	# element to be requeued by another process in-between. It may even
	# be requeued, relocked, and successfully removed in-between. In either
	# case, the number of rows affected would be 0, and do() would return
	# 0E0, perl's "0 but true" value. This is not an error. However, if
	# -1 or undef is returned, DBI.pm encountered some sort of error.
	if ( ! defined( $rows ) || $rows == -1 )
	{
		# Always carp the information, since it is an error that
		# most likely doesn't come from this module.
		my $error = $dbh->errstr();
		carp 'Cannot requeue element: ' . ( defined( $error ) ? $error : 'no error returned by DBI' );
		return 0;
	}
	
	my $requeued = ( $rows == 1 ) ? 1 : 0;
	carp "Element requeued: " . ( $requeued ? 'done' : 'already requeued or gone' ) . "." if $verbose;
	
	# Update the requeue_count on the object as well if the database update was
	# successful.
	$self->{'requeue_count'}++
		if $requeued;
	
	carp "Leaving requeue()." if $verbose;
	return $requeued;
}


=head2 success()

Removes the element from the queue after its processing has successfully been
completed.

	if ( $element->success() )
	{
		print "Element successfully removed from queue.\n";
	}
	else
	{
		print "The element has already been removed.\n";
	}

	# Possible improvement:
	# Add $self->{'lock_time'} in lock() and insist that it matches that value
	# when trying to delete the element here.
	
	# First, we try to delete the LOCKED element.
	my $rows = $dbh->do(

				FROM %s

=head2 data()

Returns the data initially queued.

	my $data = $element->data();

=cut

sub data
{
	my ( $self ) = @_;
	
	return $self->{'data'};
}


=head2 requeue_count()

Returns the number of times that the current element has been requeued.

	my $requeue_count = $element->requeue_count();

=cut

sub requeue_count
{
	my ( $self ) = @_;
	
	return $self->{'requeue_count'};
}


=head2 id()

Returns the ID of the current element

	my $id = $element->id();

=cut

sub id
{
	my ( $self ) = @_;

=head2 get_created_time()

Returns the unixtime at which the element was originally created.

	my $created = $element->get_created_time();

=cut

sub get_created_time
{
	my ( $self ) = @_;
	
	return $self->{'created'};
}


=head2 is_over_lifetime()

Returns a boolean indicating whether the current element is over the lifetime
specified when instanciating the queue. This is especially helpful if you
retrieve a large batch of elements and do long processing operations on each
of them.

	my $is_over_lifetime = $element->is_over_lifetime();

=cut

sub is_over_lifetime
{
	my ( $self ) = @_;
	my $queue = $self->get_queue();

	return 0 if !defined( $lifetime );
	
	# Check the time the element was created.
	my $created_time = $self->get_created_time();
	return time() - $created_time > $lifetime;
}


=head1 INTERNAL METHODS

=head2 get_queue()

Returns the Queue::DBI object used to pull the current element.

	my $queue = $element->get_queue();

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks to ThinkGeek (L<http://www.thinkgeek.com/>) and its corporate overlords
at Geeknet (L<http://www.geek.net/>), for footing the bill while I write code
for them!

Thanks to Jacob Rose C<< <jacob at thinkgeek.com> >>, who wrote the first
queueing module at ThinkGeek L<http://www.thinkgeek.com> and whose work
provided the inspiration to write this full-fledged queueing system.

Thanks to Jamie McCarthy for the locking mechanism improvements in version 1.1.0.

Thanks to Sergey Bond for suggesting many features added in version 1.8.x
(lifetime constraint, purge() function, get/set functions cleanup).
